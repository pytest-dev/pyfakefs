# The "linecache" module is used to read the test file in case of test failure
# to get traceback information before test tear down.
# In order to make sure that reading the test file is not faked,
# we both skip faking the module, and add the build-in open() function
# as a local function in the module (used in Python 2).
# In Python 3, we also have to set back the cached open function in tokenize.
