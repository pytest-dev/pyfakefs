# pyfakefs Release Notes
The release versions are PyPi releases.

## [Version 3.4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.4)

This version of pyfakefs does not support Python 2.6.  Python 2.6 users
must use pyfakefs 3.3 or earlier.

#### New Features
  * Added possibility to map real files or directories to another path in 
  the fake file system (see [#347](../../issues/347))
  * Configuration of `Patcher` and `TestCase`:
    * Possibility to reload modules is now also available in `Patcher`
    * Added possibility to add own fake modules via `modules_to_patch` 
    argument (see [#345](../../issues/345))
    * Dynamic loading of modules after setup is now on by default and no more
    considered experimental (see [#340](../../issues/340))
  * Added support for file descriptor path parameter in `os.scandir`
   (Python >= 3.7, Posix only) (see [#346](../../issues/346))
  * Added support to fake out backported `scandir` module ([#332](../../issues/332))
  * `IOError`/`OSError` exception messages in the fake file system now always 
  start with the message issued in the real file system in Unix systems (see [#202](../../issues/202))
  
#### Infrastructure
  * Changed API to be PEP-8 conform [#186](../../issues/186). Note: The old API is still available.
  * Removed Python 2.6 support [#293](../../issues/293)
  * Added usage documentation to GitHub Pages
  * Added contributing guide
  * Added flake8 tests to Travis CI

#### Fixes
  * Links in base path in `os.scandir` shall not be resolved ([#350](../../issues/350))
  * Fixed unit tests when run on a computer not having umask set to 0022
  * Correctly handle newline parameter in `open()` for Python 3, added support for universal newline mode in Python 2 ([#339](../../issues/339))
  * Fixed handling of case-changing rename with symlink under MacOS ([#322](../../issues/322))
  * Creating a file with a path ending with path separator did not raise ([#320](../../issues/320))
  * Fixed more problems related to `flush` ([#302](../../issues/302), [#300](../../issues/300))
  * Correctly handle opening files more than once ([#343](../../issues/343))
  * Fake `os.lstat()` crashed with several trailing path separators ([#342](../../issues/342))
  * Fixed handling of path components starting with a drive letter([#337](../../issues/337))
  * Symlinks to absolute paths were incorrectly resolved under Windows ([#341](../../issues/341))
  * Unittest mock didn't work after setUpPyfakefs ([#334](../../issues/334))
  * `os.path.split()` and `os.path.dirname()` gave incorrect results under Windows ([#335](../../issues/335))

## [Version 3.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.3)

This is the last release that supports Python 2.6.

#### New Features
  * The OS specific temp directory is now automatically created in `setUp()` (related to [#191](../../issues/191)).
    Note that this may break test code that assumes that the fake file system is completely empty at test start.
  * Added possibility to reload modules and switch on dynamic loading of modules
    after setup (experimental, see [#248](../../issues/248))
  * Added possibility to patch modules that import file system modules under
    another name, for example `import os as '_os` ([#231](../../issues/231))
  * Added support for `dir_fd` argument in several `os` functions
    ([#206](../../issues/206))
  * Added support for open file descriptor as path argument in `os.utime`,
    `os.chmod`, `os.chdir`, `os.chown`, `os.listdir`, `os.stat` and `os.lstat`
    (Python >= 3.3) ([#205](../../issues/205))
  * Added support for basic modes in fake `os.open()` ([#204](../../issues/204))
  * Added fake `os.path.samefile` implementation ([#193](../../issues/193))
  * Added support for `ns` argument in `os.utime()` (Python >= 3.3)
    ([#192](../../issues/192))
  * Added nanosecond time members in `os.stat_result` (Python >= 3.3)
    ([#196](../../issues/196))

#### Infrastructure
  * Added Travis CI tests for MacOSX (Python 2.7 and 3.6)
  * Added Appveyor CI tests for Windows (Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.6)
  * Added auto-generated documentation for development version on GitHub Pages
  * Removed most of `fake_filesystem_shutil` implementation, relying on the
    patched `os` module instead ([#194](../../issues/194))
  * Removed `fake_tempfile` and `fake_filesystem_glob`, relying on the patched
    `os` module instead ([#189](../../issues/189), [#191](../../issues/191))

#### Fixes
  * Multiple fixes of bugs found using TSTL by @agroce (see about 100 issues
    with the `TSTL` label)
    * several problems with buffer handling in high-level IO functions
    * several problems with multiple handles on the same file
    * several problems with low-level IO functions
    * incorrect exception (`IOError` vs `OSError`) raised in several cases
    * Fake `rename` did not behave like `os.rename` in many cases
    * Symlinks have not been considered or incorrectly handled in several
      functions
    * A nonexistent file that has the same name as the content of the parent
      object was seen as existing
    * Incorrect error handling during directory creation
    * many fixes for OS-specific behavior
  * Also patch modules that are loaded between `__init__()` and `setUp()`
    ([#199](../../issues/199))
  * Creating files in read-only directory was possible ([#203](../../issues/203))

## [Version 3.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.2)

#### New Features
  * The `errors` argument is supported for `io.open()` and `os.open()`
  * New methods `add_real_file()`, `add_real_directory()` and `add_real_paths()`
    make real files and directories appear within the fake file system.
    File contents are read from the real file system only as needed ([#170](../../issues/170)).
    See `example_test.py` for a usage example.
  * Deprecated `TestCase.copyRealFile()` in favor of `add_real_file()`.
    `copyRealFile()` remains only for backward compatability.  Also, some
    less-popular argument combinations have been disallowed.
  * Added this file you are reading, `CHANGES.md`, to the release manifest

#### Infrastructure
  * The `mox3` package is no longer a prerequisite--the portion required by pyfakefs
    has been integrated into pyfakefs ([#182](../../issues/182))

#### Fixes
 * Corrected the handling of byte/unicode paths in several functions ([#187](../../issues/187))
 * `FakeShutilModule.rmtree()` failed for directories ending with path separator ([#177](../../issues/177))
 * Case was incorrectly handled for added Windows drives
 * `pathlib.glob()` incorrectly handled case under MacOS ([#167](../../issues/167))
 * tox support was broken ([#163](../../issues/163))
 * On Windows it was not possible to rename a file when only the case of the file
   name changed ([#160](../../issues/160))

## [Version 3.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.1)

#### New Features
 * Added helper method `TestCase.copyRealFile()` to copy a file from
   the real file system to the fake file system. This makes it easy to use
   template, data and configuration files in your tests.
 * A pytest plugin is now installed with pyfakefs that exports the
   fake filesystem as pytest fixture `fs`.

#### Fixes
 * Incorrect disk usage calculation if too large file created ([#155](../../issues/155))

## [Version 3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.0)

#### New Features
 * Support for path-like objects as arguments in fake `os`
   and `os.path` modules (Python >= 3.6)
 * Some changes to make pyfakefs work with Python 3.6
 * Added fake `pathlib` module (Python >= 3.4) ([#29](../../issues/29))
 * Support for `os.replace` (Python >= 3.3)

 * Exception handling when using `Patcher` with py.test ([#135](../../issues/135))
 * Fake `os.listdir` returned sorted instead of unsorted entries

## [Version 2.9](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/2.9)

#### New Features
 * `io.open`, `os.open`: support for `encoding` argument ([#120](../../issues/120))

 * File permissions on deletion not correctly handled ([#27](../../issues/27))
 * `shutil.copy` error with bytes contents ([#105](../../issues/105))
