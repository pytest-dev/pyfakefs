# pyfakefs Release Notes
The released versions correspond to PyPI releases.

## [Version 5.3.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.3.2) (2023-11-30)
Bugfix release.

### Fixes
* fixed a problem with patching `_io` under Python 3.12 (see [#910](../../issues/910))
* fixed a problem with accessing the temp path if emulating Linux under Windows
  (see [#912](../../issues/912))
* fixed result of `os.walk` with a path-like top directory
  (see [#915](../../issues/915))
* properly fixed the problem that filesystem patching was still active in the pytest
  logreport phase (see [#904](../../issues/904)), the previous fix was incomplete

## [Version 5.3.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.3.1) (2023-11-15)
Mostly a bugfix release.

### Changes
* changed behavior of `add_real_directory` to be able to map a real directory
  to an existing directory in the fake filesystem (see [#901](../../issues/901))

### Fixes
* fixes the problem that filesystem patching was still active in the pytest
  logreport phase (see [#904](../../issues/904))
* Restores compatibility with PyTorch 2.0 and above, as well as with other
  classes that have custom __setattr__ methods (see [#905](../../pull/905)).

## [Version 5.3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.3.0) (2023-10-11)
Adds official support for Python 3.12.

### Changes
* add official support for Python 3.12

### Fixes
* removed a leftover debug print statement (see [#869](../../issues/869))
* make sure tests work without HOME environment set (see [#870](../../issues/870))
* automount drive or UNC path under Windows if needed for `pathlib.Path.mkdir()`
  (see [#890](../../issues/890))
* adapt patching `io.open` and `io.open_code` to work with Python 3.12
  (see [#836](../../issues/836) and [#892](../../issues/892))

## [Version 5.2.4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.2.4) (2023-08-18)
Fixes a rare problem on pytest shutdown.

### Fixes
* Clear the patched module cache on session shutdown (pytest only)
  (see [#866](../../issues/866)). Added a class method `Patcher.clear_fs_cache`
  for clearing the patched module cache.

## [Version 5.2.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.2.3) (2023-07-10)
Adds compatibility with PyPy 3.10 and Python 3.12.

### Fixes
* Re-create temp directory if it had been created before on resetting file system
  (see [#814](../../issues/814)).
* Exclude pytest `pathlib` modules from patching to avoid mixup of patched/unpatched
  code (see [#814](../../issues/814)).
* Adapt to changes in Python 3.12 beta1 (only working partially,
  see [#830](../../issues/830) and [#831](../../issues/831)).
* Adapt to changes in `shutil` in Python 3.12 beta2 (see [#814](../../issues/814)).
* Fix support for newer PyPi versions (see [#859](../../issues/859)).

### Documentation
* Added a note regarding the incompatibility of the built-in `sqlite3` module with
  `pyfakefs` (see [#850](../../issues/850))

### Infrastructure
* Added pytype check for non-test modules in CI (see [#599](../../issues/599)).
* Added tests for different pypy3 versions.
* Added codespell hook to pre-commit

## [Version 5.2.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.2.2) (2023-04-13)
Fixes a regression in 5.2.0

### Changes
* Made the user and group IDs accessible via dedicated ``get_uid`` and ``get_gid``
  functions (for symmetry to ``set_uid`` / ``set_gid``)

### Fixes
* The test fixture is now included in the source distribution and installed
  with the package.
* Some public constants in `fake_filesystem` that had been moved to `helpers` are
  made accessible from there again (see [#809](../../issues/809)).
* Add missing fake implementations for `os.getuid` and `os.getgid` (Posix only)
* Make sure a `/tmp` path exists under linux (`TMPDIR` may point elsewhere)
  (see [#810](../../issues/810))


## [Version 5.2.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.2.1) (2023-04-11)
Support for latest Python 3.12 version.

### Changes
* Adapted fake pathlib to changes in Python 3.12a7 (last alpha version)

### Fixes
* Properties defining the capabilities of some `os` functions like
  `os.supports_follow_symlinks` are now properly faked to contain the fake functions
  if the real functions are faked (see [#799](../../issues/799))

## [Version 5.2.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.2.0) (2023-03-31)
Supports current Python 3.12 version (alpha 6). We plan to make patch releases in
case of breaking changes in alpha or beta versions.

### Changes
* Fake module classes previously defined in `fake_filesystem` have now moved to
  their own modules: `fake_os.FakeOsModule`, `fake_path.FakePathModule`,
  `fake_io.FakeIoModule` and `fake_open.FakeFileOpen`. Additionally, all fake file
  classes have been moved to `fake_file`. While most of the changes shall be upwards
  compatible, we cannot exclude that we missed some problems.
* Under macOS, at test start a symlink `/tmp` to the actual temporary directory is
  now created in the fake filesystem.
* Patching of parsers for pandas >= 1.2 is removed since pandas now uses Python fs functions
  internally even when the engine selected is "c".

### Features
* added possibility to set a path inaccessible under Windows by using `chown()` with
  the `force_unix_mode` flag (see [#720](../../issues/720))
* added support for current Python 3.12 version (alpha 6)
* added support for `os.path.splitroot` (new in Python 3.12)

## [Version 5.1.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.1.0) (2023-01-12)
New version before Debian freeze

### Features
* added class level setup method `setUpClassPyfakefs` for unittest and class-scoped
  fixture `fs_class` for pytest (see [#752](../../issues/752))
* added experimental support for Python 3.12: added fake APIs for Windows junction
  support. These are not implemented and always return `False`.

### Infrastructure
* replaced end-of-life CentOS with RedHat UBI9 docker image
* added tests for pytest 7.2.0
* added black to pre-commit checks, which caused some changes to the
  coding style (max line length is now 88, always use double quotes)
* added Python 3.12 to the test suite.
* migrated to [setuptools declarative syntax](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html).
* fixed docker tests when running on branches containing forward slashes

## [Version 5.0.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/5.0.0) (2022-10-09)
New version after the transfer to `pytest-dev`.

### Changes
* the old-style API deprecated since version 3.4 has now been removed
* the method `copyRealFile` deprecated since version 3.2 has been removed -
  use `add_real_file` instead

### Infrastructure
* transferred the repository to the `pytest-dev` organization
* renamed the `master` branch to `main`
* added automatic PyPI release workflow
* move documentation from GitHub Pages to Read the Docs

### New Features
* added some support for `st_blocks` in stat result
  (see [#722](../../issues/722))

### Fixes
* fixed handling of `O_TMPFILE` in `os.open` (caused handling of
  `O_DIRECTORY` as `O_TMPFILE`) (see [#723](../../issues/723))
* fixed handling of read permissions (see [#719](../../issues/719))

## [Version 4.7.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.7.0) (2022-09-18)
Changed handling of nested fixtures and bug fixes.

### Changes
* `fs` fixtures cannot be nested; any nested `fs` fixture (for example
  inside an `fs_session` or `fs_module` fixture) will just reference the outer
  fixture (the behavior had been unexpected before)

### Fixes
* reverted a performance optimization introduced in version 3.3.0 that
  caused hanging tests with installed torch (see [#693](../../issues/693))
* do not use the built-in opener in `pathlib` as it may cause problems
  (see [#697](../../issues/697))
* add support for path-like objects in `shutil.disk_usage`
  (see [#699](../../issues/699))
* do not advertise support for Python 3.6 in `setup.py`
  (see [#707](../../issues/707))
* return the expected type from `fcntl.ioctl` and `fcntl.fcntl` calls if `arg`
  is of type `byte`; the call itself does nothing as before
* do not skip filesystem modules by name to allow using own modules with
  the same name (see [#707](../../issues/707))
* add missing support for `os.renames` (see [#714](../../issues/714))

## [Version 4.6.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.6.3) (2022-07-20)
Another patch release that fixes a regression in version 4.6.

### Changes
* automatically reset filesystem on changing `is_windows_fs` or `is_macos`
  (see [#692](../../issues/692)) - ensures better upwards compatibility in
  most cases

  :warning: Make sure you write to the filesystem _after_ you change
  `is_windows_fs` or `is_macos`, otherwise the changes will be lost.

### Fixes
* fixed regression: `os.path.exists` returned `True` for any root drive path under Windows

## [Version 4.6.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.6.2) (2022-07-14)
Patch release that fixes an error in the previous patch.

### Fixes
* fixed support for `opener` introduced in previous patch release
  (see [#689](../../issues/689))

## [Version 4.6.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.6.1) (2022-07-13)
Fixes incompatibility with Python 3.11 beta 4.

_Note_: Python 3.11 is only supported in the current beta 4 version, problems
with later beta or rc versions are still possible. We will try to fix such
problems in short order should they appear.

### Fixes
* added support for `opener` argument in `open`, which is used in `tempfile`
  in Python 3.11 since beta 4 (see [#686](../../issues/686))

### Infrastructure
* make sure tests run without `pyfakefs` installed as a package
  (see [#687](../../issues/687))

## [Version 4.6.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.6.0) (2022-07-12)
Adds support for Python 3.11, removes support for Python 3.6, changes root
path behavior under Windows.

### Changes
* Python 3.6 has reached its end of life on 2021/12/23 and is no
  longer officially supported by pyfakefs
  * `os.stat_float_times` has been removed in Python 3.7 and is therefore no
     longer supported
* under Windows, the root path is now effectively `C:\` instead of `\`; a
  path starting with `\` points to the current drive as in the real file
  system (see [#673](../../issues/673))
* fake `pathlib.Path.owner()` and `pathlib.Path.group()` now behave like the
  real methods - they look up the real user/group name for the user/group id
  that is associated with the fake file (see [#678](../../issues/678))

### New Features
* added some support for the upcoming Python version 3.11
  (see [#677](../../issues/677))
* added convenience fixtures for module- and session based `fs` fixtures
  (`fs_module` and `fs_session`)

### Fixes
* fixed an incompatibility of `tmpdir` (and probably other fixtures) with the
  module-scoped version of `fs`; had been introduced in
  pyfakefs 4.5.5 by the fix for [#666](../../issues/666)
  (see [#684](../../issues/684))

## [Version 4.5.6](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.6) (2022-03-17)
Fixes a regression which broke tests with older pytest versions (< 3.9).

### Changes
* minimum supported pytest version is now 3.0 (older versions do not work
  properly with current Python versions)

### Fixes
* only skip `_pytest.pathlib` in pytest versions where it is actually present
  (see [#669](../../issues/669))

### Infrastructure
* add tests with different pytest versions, starting with 3.0

## [Version 4.5.5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.5) (2022-02-14)
Bugfix release, needed for compatibility with pytest 7.0.

### Fixes
* correctly handle file system space for files opened in write mode
  (see [#660](../../issues/660))
* correctly handle reading/writing pipes via file
  (see [#661](../../issues/661))
* disallow `encoding` argument on binary `open()`
  (see [#664](../../issues/664))
* fixed compatibility issue with pytest 7.0.0
  (see [#666](../../issues/666))

## [Version 4.5.4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.4) (2022-01-12)
Minor bugfix release.

### Fixes
* added missing mocked functions for fake pipe (see [#650](../../issues/650))
* fixed some bytes warnings (see [#651](../../issues/651))

## [Version 4.5.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.3) (2021-11-08)
Reverts a change in the previous release that could cause a regression.

### Changes
* `os.listdir`, `os.scandir` and `pathlib.Path.listdir` now return the
  directory list in a random order only if explicitly configured in the
  file system (use `fs.shuffle_listdir_results = True` with `fs` being the
  file system). In a future version, the default may be changed to better
  reflect the real filesystem behavior (see [#647](../../issues/647))

## [Version 4.5.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.2) (2021-11-07)
This is a bugfix release.

### Changes
* `os.listdir`, `os.scandir` and `pathlib.Path.listdir` now return the
  directory list in a random order (see [#638](../../issues/638))
* the `fcntl` module under Unix is now mocked, e.g. all functions have no
  effect (this may be changed in the future if needed,
  see [#645](../../issues/645))

### Fixes
* fixed handling of alternative path separator in `os.path.split`,
  `os.path.splitdrive` and `glob.glob`
  (see [#632](../../issues/632))
* fixed handling of failed rename due to permission error
  (see [#643](../../issues/643))


## [Version 4.5.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.5.1) (2021-08-29)
This is a bugfix release.

### Fixes
* added handling of path-like where missing
* improved handling of `str`/`bytes` paths
* suppress all warnings while inspecting loaded modules
  (see [#614](../../issues/614))
* do not import pandas and related modules if it is not patched
  (see [#627](../../issues/627))
* handle `pathlib.Path.owner()` and `pathlib.Path.group` by returning
  the current user/group name (see [#629](../../issues/629))
* fixed handling of `use_known_patches=False` (could cause an exception)
* removed Python 3.5 from metadata to disable installation for that version
  (see [#615](../../issues/615))

### Infrastructure
* added test dependency check (see [#608](../../issues/608))
* skip tests failing with ASCII locale
  (see [#623](../../issues/623))

## Version 4.5.0 (2021-06-04)
Adds some support for Python 3.10 and basic type checking.

_Note_: This version has been yanked from PyPI as it erroneously allowed
installation under Python 3.5.

### New Features
  * added support for some Python 3.10 features:
    * new method `pathlib.Path.hardlink_to`
    * new `newline` argument in `pathlib.Path.write_text`
    * new `follow_symlinks` argument in `pathlib.Path.stat` and
     `pathlib.Path.chmod`
    * new 'strict' argument in `os.path.realpath`

### Changes
  * Python 3.5 has reached its end of life in September 2020 and is no longer
    supported
  * `pathlib2` is still supported, but considered to have the same
    functionality as `pathlib` and is no longer tested separately;
    the previous behavior broke newer `pathlib` features if `pathlib2`
    was installed (see [#592](../../issues/592))

### Fixes
  * correctly handle byte paths in `os.path.exists`
    (see [#595](../../issues/595))
  * Update `fake_pathlib` to support changes coming in Python 3.10
    ([see](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/19342)
  * correctly handle UNC paths in `os.path.split` and in directory path
    evaluation (see [#606](../../issues/606))

### Infrastructure
  * added mypy checks in CI (see [#599](../../issues/599))

## [Version 4.4.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.4.0) (2021-02-24)
Adds better support for Python 3.8 / 3.9.

### New Features
  * added support for `pathlib.Path.link_to` (new in Python 3.8)
    (see [#580](../../issues/580))
  * added support for `pathlib.Path.readlink` (new in Python 3.9)
    (see [#584](../../issues/584))
  * added `FakeFilesystem.create_link` convenience method which creates
    intermittent directories (see [#580](../../issues/580))

### Fixes
  * fixed handling of pipe descriptors in the fake filesystem
    (see [#581](../../issues/581))
  * added non-functional argument `effective_ids` to `os.access`
    (see [#585](../../issues/585))
  * correctly handle `os.file` for unreadable files
    (see [#588](../../issues/588))

### Infrastructure
  * added automatic documentation build and check-in

## [Version 4.3.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.3.3) (2020-12-20)

Another bugfix release.

### Fixes
* Reverted one Windows-specific optimization that can break tests under some
  conditions (see [#573](../../issues/573))
* Setting `os` did not reset `os.sep` and related variables,
  fixed null device name, added `os.pathsep` and missing `os.path` variables
  (see [#572](../../issues/572))

## [Version 4.3.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.3.2) (2020-11-26)

This is a bugfix release that fixes a regression introduced in version 4.2.0.

### Fixes
* `open` calls had not been patched for modules with a name ending with "io"
  (see [#569](../../issues/569))

## [Version 4.3.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.3.1) (2020-11-23)

This is an update to the performance release, with more setup caching and the
possibility to disable it.

### Changes
* Added caching of patched modules to avoid lookup overhead
* Added `use_cache` option and `clear_cache` method to be able
  to deal with unwanted side effects of the newly introduced caching

### Infrastructure
* Moved CI builds to GitHub Actions for performance reasons

## [Version 4.3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.3.0) (2020-11-19)

This is mostly a performance release. The performance of the pyfakefs setup has
been decreasing sufficiently, especially with the 4.x releases. This release
corrects that by making the most expansive feature optional, and by adding some
other performance improvements. This shall decrease the setup time by about a
factor of 20, and it shall now be comparable to the performance of the 3.4
release.

### Changes
  * The `patchfs` decorator now expects a positional argument instead of the
    keyword arguments `fs`. This avoids confusion with the pytest `fs`
    fixture and conforms to the behavior of `mock.patch`. You may have to
    adapt the argument order if you use the `patchfs` and `mock.patch`
    decorators together (see [#566](../../issues/566))
  * Default arguments that are file system functions are now _not_ patched by
    default to avoid a large performance impact. An additional parameter
    `patch_default_args` has been added that switches this behavior on
    (see [#567](../../issues/567)).
  * Added performance improvements in the test setup, including caching the
    unpatched modules

## [Version 4.2.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.2.1) (2020-11-02)

This is a bugfix release that fixes a regression issue.

### Fixes
  * remove dependency of pyfakefs on `pytest` (regression,
    see [#565](../../issues/565))

## [Version 4.2.0](https://pydpi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.2.0) (2020-11-01)

#### New Features
  * add support for the `buffering` parameter in `open`
    (see [#549](../../issues/549))
  * add possibility to patch `io.open_code` using the new argument
    `patch_open_code` (since Python 3.8)
    (see [#554](../../issues/554))
  * add possibility to set file system OS via `FakeFilesystem.os`

#### Fixes
  * fix check for link in `os.walk` (see [#559](../../issues/559))
  * fix handling of real files in combination with `home` if simulating
    Posix under Windows (see [#558](../../issues/558))
  * do not call fake `open` if called from skipped module
    (see [#552](../../issues/552))
  * do not call fake `pathlib.Path` if called from skipped module
    (see [#553](../../issues/553))
  * fixed handling of `additional_skip_names` with several module components
  * allow to open existing pipe file descriptor
    (see [#493](../../issues/493))
  * do not truncate file on failed flush
    (see [#548](../../issues/548))
  * suppress deprecation warnings while collecting modules
    (see [#542](../../issues/542))
  * add support for `os.truncate` and `os.ftruncate`
    (see [#545](../../issues/545))

#### Infrastructure
  * fixed another problem with CI test scripts not always propagating errors
  * make sure pytest will work without pyfakefs installed
   (see [#550](../../issues/550))

## [Version 4.1.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.1.0) (2020-07-12)

#### New Features
  * Added some support for pandas (`read_csv`, `read_excel` and more), and
   for django file locks to work with the fake filesystem
   (see [#531](../../issues/531))

#### Fixes
  * `os.expanduser` now works with a bytes path
  * Do not override global warnings setting in `Deprecator`
    (see [#526](../../issues/526))
  * Make sure filesystem modules in `pathlib` are patched
    (see [#527](../../issues/527))
  * Make sure that alternative path separators are correctly handled under Windows
    (see [#530](../../issues/530))

#### Infrastructure
  * Make sure all temporary files from real fs tests are removed

## [Version 4.0.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/4.0.2) (2020-03-04)

This as a patch release that only builds for Python 3. Note that
versions 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 will be removed from PyPI to disable
installing them under Python 2.

#### Fixes
  * Do not build for Python 2 (see [#524](../../issues/524))

## Version 4.0.1 (2020-03-03)

This as a bug fix release for a regression bug.

_Note_: This version has been yanked from PyPI as it erroneously allowed
installation under Python 2. This has been fixed in version 4.0.2.

#### Fixes
  * Avoid exception if using `flask-restx` (see [#523](../../issues/523))

## Version 4.0.0 (2020-03-03)

Python 2.7, you can continue to use pyfakefs 3.7.x.

_Note_: This version has been yanked from PyPI as it erroneously allowed
installation under Python 2. This has been fixed in version 4.0.2.

#### Changes
  * Removed Python 2.7 and 3.4 support (see [#492](../../issues/492))

#### New Features
  * Added support for handling keyword-only arguments in some `os` functions
  * Added possibility to pass additional parameters to `fs` pytest fixture
  * Added automatic patching of default arguments that are file system
    functions
  * Added convenience decorator `patchfs` to patch single functions using
    the fake filesystem

#### Fixes
  * Added missing `st_ino` in `makedir` (see [#515](../../issues/515))
  * Fixed handling of relative paths in `lresolve` / `os.lstat`
    (see [#516](../../issues/516))
  * Fixed handling of byte string paths
    (see [#517](../../issues/517))
  * Fixed `os.walk` if path ends with path separator
    (see [#512](../../issues/512))
  * Fixed handling of empty path in `os.makedirs`
    (see [#510](../../issues/510))
  * Fixed handling of `os.TMPFILE` flag under Linux
    (see [#509](../../issues/509) and [#511](../../issues/511))
  * Adapted fake `pathlib` to changes in Python 3.7.6/3.8.1
    (see [#508](../../issues/508))
  * Fixed behavior of `os.makedirs` in write-protected directory
    (see [#507](../../issues/507))

## [Version 3.7.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.7.2) (2020-03-02)

This version backports some fixes from main.

#### Fixes
  * Fixed handling of relative paths in `lresolve` / `os.lstat`
    (see [#516](../../issues/516))
  * Fixed `os.walk` if path ends with path separator
    (see [#512](../../issues/512))
  * Fixed handling of empty path in `os.makedirs`
    (see [#510](../../issues/510))

    Note that this may break test code that assumes that the fake file system is completely empty at test start.
  * Added possibility to reload modules and switch on dynamic loading of modules
    after setup (experimental, see [#248](../../issues/248))
  * Added possibility to patch modules that import file system modules under

    with the `TSTL` label)
    * several problems with buffer handling in high-level IO functions
    * several problems with multiple handles on the same file
    * several problems with low-level IO functions
    * incorrect exception (`IOError` vs `OSError`) raised in several cases

#### New Features
  * The `errors` argument is supported for `io.open()` and `os.open()`
  * New methods `add_real_file()`, `add_real_directory()` and `add_real_paths()`
    make real files and directories appear within the fake file system.
    File contents are read from the real file system only as needed ([#170](../../issues/170)).
    See `example_test.py` for a usage example.
  * Deprecated `TestCase.copyRealFile()` in favor of `add_real_file()`.
    `copyRealFile()` remains only for backward compatibility.  Also, some
    less-popular argument combinations have been disallowed.
  * Added this file you are reading, `CHANGES.md`, to the release manifest

   the real file system to the fake file system. This makes it easy to use
   template, data and configuration files in your tests.
 * A pytest plugin is now installed with pyfakefs that exports the
   fake filesystem as pytest fixture `fs`.

#### Fixes
 * Incorrect disk usage calculation if too large file created ([#155](../../issues/155))
