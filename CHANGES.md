# pyfakefs Release Notes 
The release versions are PyPi releases.

## Version 3.3 (as yet unreleased)

#### New Features
  * Added support for basic modes in fake `os.open()` ([#204](../../issues/204)). 
  * Added fake `os.path.samefile` implementation ([#193](../../issues/193))
  * Added support for `ns` argument in `os.utime()` (Python >= 3.3) ([#192](../../issues/192)).
  * Added nanosecond time members in `os.stat_result` (Python >= 3.3) ([#196](../../issues/196)).

#### Infrastructure

#### Fixes
  * Incorrect error handling during directory creation ([#209](../../issues/209)) 
  * Creating files in read-only directory was possible ([#203](../../issues/203))

## [Version 3.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.2)

#### New Features
  * The `errors` argument is supported for `io.open()` and `os.open()`
  * New methods `add_real_file()`, `add_real_directory()` and `add_real_paths()`
    make real files and directories appear within the fake file system.
    File contents are read from the real file system only as needed ([#170](../../issues/170)).
    See `example_test.py` for a usage example.
  * Deprecated `TestCase.copyRealFile()` in favor of `add_real_file()`.
    `copyRealFile()` remains only for backward compatability.  Also, some
    less-popular argument combinations have been disallowed.
  * Added this file you are reading, `CHANGES.md`, to the release manifest

#### Infrastructure
  * The `mox3` package is no longer a prerequisite--the portion required by pyfakefs
    has been integrated into pyfakefs ([#182](../../issues/182))
  
#### Fixes
 * Corrected the handling of byte/unicode paths in several functions ([#187](../../issues/187))
 * `FakeShutilModule.rmtree()` failed for directories ending with path separator ([#177](../../issues/177))
 * Case was incorrectly handled for added Windows drives 
 * `pathlib.glob()` incorrectly handled case under MacOS ([#167](../../issues/167))
 * tox support was broken ([#163](../../issues/163))
 * On Windows it was not possible to rename a file when only the case of the file
   name changed ([#160](../../issues/160))
 
## [Version 3.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.1)

#### New Features
 * Added helper method `TestCase.copyRealFile()` to copy a file from
   the real file system to the fake file system. This makes it easy to use
   template, data and configuration files in your tests.
 * A pytest plugin is now installed with pyfakefs that exports the 
   fake filesystem as pytest fixture `fs`.

#### Fixes
 * Incorrect disk usage calculation if too large file created ([#155](../../issues/155))

## [Version 3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/3.0)

   and `os.path` modules (Python >= 3.6)
 * Some changes to make pyfakefs work with Python 3.6 
 * Added fake `pathlib` module (Python >= 3.4) ([#29](../../issues/29))
 * Support for `os.replace` (Python >= 3.3)

 * `glob.glob`, `glob.iglob`: support for `recursive` argument (Python >= 3.5) ([#116](../../issues/116))
 * Support for `glob.iglob` ([#59](../../issues/59))
 
#### Infrastructure
 * Added [auto-generated documentation](http://jmcgeheeiv.github.io/pyfakefs/)

 * Exception handling when using `Patcher` with py.test ([#135](../../issues/135))
 * Fake `os.listdir` returned sorted instead of unsorted entries
 
## [Version 2.9](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfakefs/2.9)

#### New Features

 * File permissions on deletion not correctly handled ([#27](../../issues/27))
 * `shutil.copy` error with bytes contents ([#105](../../issues/105))
